From time to time you may find something not working.

## Blank map

### RStudio viewer is blank 

Try opening in a browser. [Issue 18](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues/18)

### Browser is blank

Look at the javascript console for any errors. [Issue 95](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues/95)
