From time to time you may find something not working. If your issue isn't covered on this page, head to the [github issues page](https://github.com/symbolixau/mapdeck/issues), have a look there, and if you can't find a solution feel free to open a new issue

## RStudio viewer is blank 

Try opening in a browser. [Issue 18](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues/18)

## Browser is blank

Look at the javascript console for any errors. [Issue 95](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues/95)

## Map doesn't zoom to the layer

Are you subsetting an `sf` object without the `sf` library loaded? [See here](file:///Users/dave/Documents/github/mapdeck/docs/articles/tips_tricks.html#sf)

Or are you plotting GeoJSON or an `sfencodedLite` object? The bounding box is not calculated for either of these, so the map doesn't know where to focus
